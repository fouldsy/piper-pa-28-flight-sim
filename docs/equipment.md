# Equipment for building the flight sim

I use a mix of power tools and a cheap [Wen rotary tool](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BYRFH8) rather than an actual Dremel.

The main thing people ask about, especially for building the [Garmin G1000 suite](g1000.md) is what type of laser cutter and 3D printer I use. The answers are kinda boring, but shows what's possible with care and attention during the build.

## Laser cutter

Although I have access to a 60w Epilogue and a Universal laser cutter at the Garage at work, all of the current components (including the full [Garmin G1000 suite](g1000.md)) were cut on a cheap K40 laser in my own garage.

Sure, I may have gotten lucky, but I also knew enough from those other laser cutters to take my time in setting up the K40, aligning the mirrors carefully, and then understanding how to design parts and use a laser cutter. I've been very happy with the K40 laser.

Upgrade-wise, all I've done is to [3D-print a new bracket for fume extraction](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2809440), and [replace the blower motor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003EX02DA) for the extractor. It does a much better job with fumes now.

I also then use [K40 Whisperer](https://www.scorchworks.com/K40whisperer/k40whisperer.html) to process the jobs. I never even tried to install the crappy software that came with the unit.

## 3D printer

Like a laser cutter, a 3D printer has completely changed how I approach designing and building things.

I have a [Creality Ender 3](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BR3F9N6), which is a great balance of performance and budget. Take care, as there are some knock-offs. I had a problem with the control board shortly after I received the unit, but it was quickly diagosed and replaced under warranty by the authorized seller I'd used.

I did 3D-print a few upgrade parts such as a [fan guard](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2935204) and [filament guide](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2917932), but then similar to the K40 laser cutter, time and care went into assembling the printer, and it's worked out great.

I use a Raspbery Pi 3B+ running [Octoprint](https://octoprint.org/) to control 3D printing, and an old Logitech C270 webcam to monitor the status of print jobs.
